/**
 * Description: I intend to demonstrate how Interfaces work. Unlike Inheritance which 
 * can be understood as a "Is-a" relationship. Interfaces use the implement keyword rather than extend.
 * Interfaces are a set of rules that define behavior.
 * 
 * They do NOT containi business logic, only the required method signatures.
 * 
 * How are they different between abstract classes? Though, they're similar, they're quite different.
 * An Interface is a set of rules that define behavior and that's it.
 * 
 * An abstract class can enforce behavior and can do other class things.
